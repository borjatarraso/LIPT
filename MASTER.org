*IMPORTANT*: Latest master org mode file is always stored Github in
https://github.com/borjatarraso/LIPT first and locally in
file:~/Dropbox/LIPT/MASTER.org. Any other backup copies will not ensure
the latest org file version. MASTER.org contains the links to other org
files, which has been split to avoid massive unrelated content.
