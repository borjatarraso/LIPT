* tcpdump

[[Basic filters:]]

Show all traffic based on some IP address:

 tcpdump host <ip>

Show all traffic with some destination IP:

 tcpdump dst <ip>

Show all traffic with some source IP:

 tcpdump src <ip>

Show all traffic with involves some specific port:

 tcpdump port <port>

Show all traffic with some destination port:

 tcpdump dst port <port>

Show all traffic with some source port:

 tcpdump src port <port>

Show all traffic with involves some network:

 tcpdump net <ip>/<netmask>

Show all traffic with specific protocol:

 tcpdump <protocol>

[["and", "or" and "not" (not can be also used as !):]]

Show all traffic for some protocol, from some source ip address with some destination port:

 tcpdump <protocol> and src <ip> and dst port <port>

Show all traffic coming from some network with some specific destination network or some other destination network:

 tcpdump src net <ip_network_address>/<netmask> and dst net <ip_network_address>/<netmask> or <ip_network_address>/<netmask>

Show all traffic to some destination host coming from some network and is not some specific protocol traffic:

 tcpdump dst <ip> and src net <ip_network_address>/<netmask> and not <protocol>

Show all traffic coming from some host and going to some destination port or some other destination port:

 tcpdump 'src <ip> and (dst port <port> or <port>)'

Show all tcp traffic ACK:

 tcpdump 'tcp[13] & 16 != 0'

Show all tcp traffic SYN:

 tcpdump 'tcp[13] & 2 != 0'

Show all tcp traffic FIN:

 tcpdump 'tcp[13] & 1 != 0'

Show all tcp traffic SYN-ACK:

 tcpdump 'tcp[13] = 18'

Display ipv6 traffic:

 tcpdump ip6

Display port range traffic:

 tcpdump portrange <portfrom>-<portto>

Display packets with smaller sizes:

 tcpdump less <packetsize>
 or
 tcpdump < <packetsize>

Display packets with bigger sizes:

 tcpdump greater <packetsize>
 or
 tcpdump > <packetsize>

[[Arguments important:]]

 -n   --> names are not resolved
 -nn  --> names and port names are not resolved
 -X   --> show hex and ascii content of the packet
 -XX  --> show hex and ascii content of the packet + ethernet header
 -S   --> display from relative to absolute sequence numbers
 -i   --> in which interface will sniff
 -v   --> verbose
 -vv  --> more verbose
 -vvv --> super verbose
 -c   --> packets to capture
 -s   --> define the snap lenght (size) of the capture in bytes
 -s0  --> get everything
 -e   --> get ethernet header
 -q   --> show less protocol information
 -E   --> decrypt IPSEC traffic by providing an encryption key
 -w   --> write the output in a cap file
 -r   --> read a cap file
 -t   --> dont print timestamp
 -tt  --> print unformated timestamp
 -ttt --> print delta micro second timestamp
 -tttt  --> print a timestampt in default format
 -ttttt --> print a delta micro second timestamp
