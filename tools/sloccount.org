 $ sloccount directory

Options:

There are several options that control which files are selected for counting:

 --duplicates   Count all duplicate files as normal files
 --crossdups    Count duplicate files if they're in different data directory
                children.
 --autogen      Count automatically generated files
 --follow       Follow symbolic links (normally they're ignored)
 --addlang      Add languages to be counted that normally aren't shown.
 --append       Add more files to the data directory

There are many options for controlling the output:

 --filecount     Show counts of files instead of SLOC.
 --details       Present details: present one line per source code file.
 --wide          Show "wide" format.  Ignored if "--details" selected
 --multiproject  Assume each directory is for a different project
                 (this modifies the effort estimation calculations)
 --effort F E    Change the effort estimation model, so that it uses
                 F as the factor and E as the exponent.
 --schedule F E  Change the schedule estimation model, so that it uses
                 F as the factor and E as the exponent.
 --personcost P  Change the average annual salary to P.
 --overhead O    Change the annual overhead to O.
 --              End of options
